## Project structure and motivation

-   Cores is a background service that runs in the background and monitors your computer's hardware components. It's built on top of [Libre Hardware Monitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor). It provides additional features like GPU usage and drive health monitoring. On Windows it's written in C# and runs as a Windows service. It provides an option to connect to your computer remotely with a P2P connection for monitoring. It also provides a REST API and a WebSocket server if you want to use the data.

-   The UI is built with Svelte and it's available on the desktop as a Tauri desktop app. You can access it on the [website](https://cores.levminer.com/home) and you can remotely connect to your computer if you enabled remote connections and copied your connection code.
